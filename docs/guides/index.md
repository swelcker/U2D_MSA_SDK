# Guide's - Intro

This guide's will show you how to use **msaSDK** with most of its features.


## Install msaSDK

The first step is to install FastAPI.

For the tutorial, you might want to install it with all the optional dependencies and features:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install -U msaSDK

---> 100%
```

</div>

...that also includes `uvicorn`, that you can use as the server that runs your code.


## Inherited from FastAPI

msaSDk and specifically MSAApp is inherited and build from and with FastAPI. The 'msaapi' is just bringing together some stuff to integrate some other libraries.
